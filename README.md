 ## Who Am I?

 I recently finished studying programming and I'm eager to find my first big job. Apart from coding, I enjoy hanging out with friends, reading, working on personal projects, and being outdoors. Right now, I live in Tandil, Argentina, but I'm open to moving for work. At first, I got into programming because of the job opportunities, but now I love solving software problems. Finishing my degree was a big accomplishment, and it motivated me to keep searching for opportunities. Lately, I've been working on a project about finances‚Äîa billing system. I believe in teamwork, family, taking initiative, and being proactive. My big goal is to be financially stable so I can focus on work. When I start a job, I give it my all and family is really important to me.
